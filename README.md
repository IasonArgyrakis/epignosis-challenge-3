How to start the app 



`
vendor/bin/sail up
`

this should (hopefullyðŸ˜…) start the laravel env with a React frontend that I added to the docker-compose file




On a different terminal run the following 

`
vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
`


`
vendor/bin/sail artisan passport:install --force
`
